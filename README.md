# convert-windowsimage

This is a fork of Convert-WindowsImage from Nerdhile: https://github.com/nerdile/convert-windowsimage

## Changes from the Nerdhile version:
- .Net classes have changed vastly since originally written. The corrected/update names of the classes and packages needed to be located, then code changed to download them as needed.
